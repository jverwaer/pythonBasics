    "<img src=\"NDVI_africa2.png\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "On a certain day someone gets infected with a contagious disease. The location is marked with a red dot on the map. \n",
    "\n",
    "The disease spreads to neighboring locations every day. Suppose that the disease can only spread to locations north, south, east, and west (not diagonally). This is illustrated in the figure below.\n",

    "Write a program that simulates the spread of the disease over time. It should show a map showing the spread of the disease day after day, with infected locations marked in red."

    "\n",
    "1. Read `NDVI_africa.png` with `imread()` and visualize it using `imshow()`.\n",
    "2. Since the disease cannot spread on water we have to identify land and water areas. Create a binary map `africa_binary` of Africa where land pixels are 1 and water pixels are 0. You can use a threshold on the NDVI values to do this.\n",
    "Choose $0.1$ a threshold.\n",
    "3. Create an array of `infected` locations, where infected land pixels are 2, non-infected land pixels are 1 and water pixels are 0.\n",
    "4. Choose a starting location for the infection (a pixel on land).  Indicate the infection point as 2 in `infected`. Plot the map with the infection point.\n",
    "5. For 1 day, update the infected map by spreading the infection to neighboring land pixels (north, south, east, west) of already infected pixels.\n",
    "6. Visualize the spread of the disease over time using `imshow()`. You can use `pause()` to create an animation effect."
