    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is a powerful library that can be used to create a wide range of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, pie charts, and more. It provides a high degree of control over the appearance of plots and allows you to create professional-quality visualizations with ease.\n",
    "\n",

    "```python\n",
    "    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
