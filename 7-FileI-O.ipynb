    "In the previous chapters, we either defined our data directly in the code, asked the user for data input, or generated it using functions. However, in many cases, we need to read data from external sources, such as files. \n",
    "\n",
    "A file is a collection of data stored on a disk. Files can be text files, which contain human-readable text (coded as ASCII or Unicode), or binary files, which contain data in a format that is not human-readable. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.2 File location\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a file, you need to specify the file location. The file location can be either an absolute path or a relative path:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An **absolute path** specifies the location of a file from the root directory.\n",
    "* A **relative path** specifies the location of a file relative to the current working directory. \n",

    "For example, if you have a file called `example.txt` in the current working directory, you can open it using the relative path `'example.txt'`. If you have a file called `example.txt` in a directory called `files` in the current working directory, you can open it using the relative path `'files/example.txt'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, we assume that all files are in the `files` directory. This means that you can open a file called `example.txt` using the relative path `'files/example.txt'`.\n"
